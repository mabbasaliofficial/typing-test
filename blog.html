    <h3>1. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Storage :</strong> The LocalStorage read-only property of the Window interface
      allows you to access a storage object for the document origin; Saved data is saved across
      browser sessions. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, although localStorage data does
      not have an expiration time. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Session Storage :</strong> SessionStorage is only available for the duration of the
      browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed).
    </p>

    <h3>2. What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>global scope :</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or second
      brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the
      variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can
      access that variable. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>block scope :</strong> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope
      can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the second brackets {}. Now, these second
      brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed
      to refer to these variables from within the second brackets {}.
